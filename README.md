# Open Opal

A native macOS app for the Opal C1 webcam. Opal has discontinued the C1 and its
Composer software; this project keeps the camera working.

The C1 is built on Luxonis' [DepthAI](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-core)
platform, so it can be driven with open-source tools. Open Opal talks to the
camera directly over USB.

## Features

- Exposure: auto, or manual shutter and ISO, with EV compensation and AE lock
- Focus: autofocus modes, manual lens position, click anywhere to focus
- White balance: presets or manual Kelvin
- Anti-banding for 50/60 Hz lighting
- Sharpness, denoise, brightness, contrast, saturation
- 4K / 1080p / 720p, up to 42 fps
- Background blur, rendered in Metal with Apple's Vision segmentation
- Optional exposure metering on your face instead of the whole frame
- Menu bar controls with a live preview and an icon-aligned pointer
- Drag the header to float and resize; drop near the menu bar icon to dock

The app starts in the menu bar without a Dock icon or a separate main window.
Click the camera-aperture icon to open the controls. The header button also
switches between docked and floating controls. Clicking away or pressing Escape
hides the panel without disconnecting the camera. Click the icon to reopen it.
Quit ends the camera session.

Frames are downscaled on the camera's own ISP before crossing USB, which keeps
glass-to-screen latency around 45 ms at 1080p30. The toolbar shows the live
number.

## Building

Needs an Apple silicon Mac on macOS 26 or later, Xcode 26, and
`brew install cmake ninja xcodegen`.

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh     # fetches and builds depthai-core
./scripts/fetch-models.sh  # downloads the Core ML depth model
xcodegen generate
open OpenOpal.xcodeproj    # then build & run from Xcode (⌘R)
```

To build from the command line and install to /Applications:

```sh
xcodebuild -project OpenOpal.xcodeproj -scheme OpenOpal \
  -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build
cp -R build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Release/OpenOpal.app /Applications/
```

Use Release builds for day-to-day use — Debug builds noticeably stutter in UI
animations.

## The hardware

Little of this is documented elsewhere, so for the record:

- The C1 is a Luxonis DepthAI device: an Intel Movidius **Myriad X** VPU
  (USB VID `0x03E7`) paired with a Sony **IMX582** 48MP sensor (module name
  `LCM48`) and a real autofocus lens.
- The sensor has **no native 1080p mode**. Its readout modes are
  3840×2160 (2–42 fps), 4000×3000 (2–30 fps), and 5312×6000 (1–10 fps).
  That's also why the app caps out at 42 fps.
- Full 4K NV12 at 30 fps is ~370 MB/s, which saturates USB 3 and costs
  ~300 ms of latency. So the app always captures 4K and downscales on the
  camera's ISP before the frame crosses the wire — that's the ~45 ms figure.
- The sensor is mounted upside down in the housing; the stock firmware
  compensates silently. A custom pipeline has to rotate on the ISP itself
  (`setImageOrientation`), or everything arrives inverted.
- Autofocus/auto-exposure regions are specified in **sensor** coordinates
  (3840×2160), not output coordinates — the depthai docs mention this, and
  getting it wrong pins every region into the top-left quadrant.
- The 3A loops (autofocus, auto-exposure, auto-white-balance) run on the
  camera, not the host.

## How it works

The C1's flash holds firmware that presents it as a standard UVC webcam —
that's why it works in any app with nothing installed. Open Opal takes the
camera over instead: it resets the VPU into its ROM bootloader, uploads the
~26 MB DepthAI firmware into the camera's **RAM**, and sends over a small
pipeline graph that the firmware instantiates on the VPU. Quitting reboots
the camera back to its stock firmware within a few seconds. Nothing is ever
written to flash, so the takeover can't brick anything. The app narrates
each stage live while connecting, with real sizes and timings.

```

The background blur uses Vision person segmentation, computed for the same
frame it masks (several frames are analysed concurrently to hold 30 fps),
then blurred in linear light so highlights bloom instead of greying out. An
optional depth-graded mode uses
[Depth Anything V2](https://huggingface.co/apple/coreml-depth-anything-v2-small)
for distance-based falloff.

## Virtual camera

Open Opal installs a CoreMediaIO system extension that publishes **"Open Opal
Camera"** to every app on the Mac — Zoom, Meet, FaceTime, anything. It carries
the processed image, blur and all. When the app isn't running it shows a placard
rather than a frozen frame.

Installing it requires a signed and notarized build; see
[docs/SIGNING.md](docs/SIGNING.md). The app itself runs fine unsigned.

## Status

Working: camera control, live preview, background blur, virtual camera.
