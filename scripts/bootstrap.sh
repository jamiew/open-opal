#     #  ifndef fdopen
#     #    define fdopen(fd,mode) NULL   /* No fdopen() */

# for *classic* Mac OS and macro-defines fdopen to NULL -- which then destroys
# the real fdopen() declaration in the SDK's <_stdio.h>, failing the build. This
# is still present in 1.2.13, so bumping the version alone does not fix it.
# Pre-defining fdopen as itself makes the `#ifndef fdopen` guard false, so the
# bad macro is never installed; the identity macro doesn't recurse, so real call
# sites compile unchanged.
