# (a) SIP disabled + `systemextensionsctl developer on`, which recent macOS
# betas refuse while SIP is on, or (b) Developer ID + notarization. So (b).
#
# Without the notarization ticket, OSSystemExtensionManager rejects the
# extension and — misleadingly — reports "Extension not found in App bundle",
# even though the bundle is present and correctly formed.
