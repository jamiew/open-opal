/// Monocular depth via Apple's Core ML build of Depth Anything V2 (Small, F16),
/// running on the Neural Engine.
///
/// This is the piece Opal didn't have. Their bokeh came from a small
/// segmentation network on the camera's Myriad VPU, which can only answer
/// "person or not person" — so a chair one metre behind you and a wall six
/// metres behind you were blurred by exactly the same amount. That flatness is
/// what reads as fake. A continuous depth map lets blur fall off with real
/// distance, which is what a lens actually does.
///
/// Two details matter when consuming this model:
///
///  1. It outputs **inverse** depth (disparity): larger = *closer*. The renderer
///     wants 0 = near, 1 = far, so we invert.
///  2. The output carries no metric scale, and the model min-max normalizes it
///     *internally, per frame* — every frame spans exactly 0...1 regardless of
///     what's in it. So when you lift a hand toward the lens, the far wall's
///     value changes even though the wall didn't move. That's "depth swim", and
///     it cannot be fixed here: rescaling a range that's already [0,1] is a
///     no-op. It's dealt with downstream, by temporal smoothing in the shader.
